# OLYMPICS SQL PROJECT:
I'm thrilled to share my latest SQL project with you all!
I recently dove into the world of Olympic data, utilizing a dataset downloaded from Kaggle, and wrote a series of queries to uncover some fascinating insights. This project was a true journey of exploration, utilizing a plethora of SQL functions to extract valuable insights.

Here's a sneak peek at the questions I tackled:
1. How Many Olympics Games Have Been Held?
Leveraging SELECT, COUNT, and AS to determine the total number of Olympic Games held.
2. List Down All Olympics Games Held So Far?
Using SELECT and ORDER BY to compile a comprehensive list of Olympic Games.
3. How Many Athletes Won Gold Medals?
Employing SELECT, COUNT, and WHERE conditions to identify Gold Medal winners.
4. Which Teams Participated in the 1992 Summer Games?
Harnessing SELECT and WHERE conditions to extract the participating teams.
5. Top 3 Cities in Terms of Total Number of Medals?
Combining SELECT, GROUP BY, COUNT, LIMIT and ORDER BY to unveil the top medal-winning cities.
6. Average Age of Female & Male Athletes Who Won Medals?
Calculating the average age using SELECT, GROUP BY, and AVG.
7. Top 5 Sports in Which Female Athletes Have Won the Most Medals?
Utilizing SELECT, GROUP BY, COUNT, ORDER BY, and LIMIT to identify the top sports for female athletes.
8. Mention the Total Number of Nations Who Participated in Each Olympic Game?
Employing SELECT, WITH,COUNT, GROUP BY, and JOIN to reveal the participating nations for each Olympic Game.
9. Show How Many Males and Females Participated from All Countries?
Utilizing SELECT, COUNT, GROUP BY, JOIN to distinguish between male and female participants.


This project was not only a fantastic learning experience but also a deep dive into the rich history of the Olympics. This project has been a captivating blend of data analysis and SQL.
